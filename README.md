# ReactLearning

This is a repo which help people that want to learn about React without coding.

## Run the docs viewer

python -m http.server

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Or use any static file server:

- VS Code: Use "Live Server" extension
- Node: `npx serve .`
- Ruby: `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000`
