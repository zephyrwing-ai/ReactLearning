sharing state between components
用于实现鱼和熊掌不可兼得的效果，一个组件点击展示，另外一个组件就会消失。就像你点外卖，选择配送的方式只能够是二选一如果你点击了立即配送，那么你就不能再点击定时配送了

      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel title="About">
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel title="Etymology">
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
